✅ FIRST: Is this Milestone 2 DIFFERENT from what we discussed earlier?

👉 YES, slightly different focus
👉 But your Milestone 1 foundation perfectly supports this Milestone 2

Earlier we spoke generally about domain data.
This Milestone 2 is specifically about:

Floor plans + file uploads + bulk import + basic hierarchy APIs

That’s totally fine and very realistic.

🎯 Milestone 2 – IN SIMPLE WORDS

After login, users should be able to
upload site plans and import large data instead of entering everything manually.

Think like this:

Not drawing floor plans yet

Just uploading & managing files and data

📦 DELIVERABLE-BY-DELIVERABLE EXPLANATION (ORAL, CLEAR)
1️⃣ Floor plan upload (Web & Mobile)

What this means:

User uploads PDF / image of building or floor plan

File is stored

Metadata is saved in DB

👉 No editing, just upload & view.

2️⃣ Image processing & file service (S3 / MinIO)

Meaning:

Files should NOT be stored inside your project folder

They go to:

Cloud storage (S3) OR

Local object storage (MinIO)

👉 For internship:

MinIO is PERFECT (looks professional, works locally)

3️⃣ Bulk space import (CSV / XLSX)

Meaning:

User uploads Excel/CSV file

File contains:

Space name

Type

Area

Floor reference

System should:

Validate file

Read rows

Prepare data

👉 No DB insert immediately (important).

4️⃣ Campus / Building / Floor hierarchy UI

Meaning:

Simple UI to:

Select property

Select building

Select floor

👉 No fancy design
👉 Just dropdowns / tree view

5️⃣ Basic REST APIs

Required APIs:

Create / list properties

Create / list buildings

Create / list floors

Create / list spaces

👉 Pure CRUD
👉 JWT-protected

6️⃣ Preview & confirmation workflow

Very important concept:

Flow:

Upload CSV

Show preview table

User clicks Confirm

THEN save to DB

👉 This avoids bad data.

7️⃣ Integration testing

Meaning:

Test upload → process → save

Test invalid files

Test large file handling

👉 Simple integration tests are enough.

🧠 VERY IMPORTANT: DOES THIS MATCH YOUR PROJECT DOCUMENT?

👉 YES — 100% MATCH

Your DB diagram already has:

files

attachments

floors

spaces

buildings

properties

Milestone 2 is just ACTIVATING THESE TABLES.

❗ What Milestone 2 is NOT asking for

❌ Drawing on floor plans
❌ GIS maps
❌ Signal heatmaps
❌ Complex UI

So don’t worry.

🪜 RECOMMENDED ORDER TO DO Milestone 2

I strongly suggest this sequence 👇

STEP 2.1

Basic APIs:
Property → Building → Floor → Space

STEP 2.2

File upload service (MinIO)

STEP 2.3

Floor plan upload (PDF/Image)

STEP 2.4

CSV/XLSX bulk import + preview

STEP 2.5

Integration testing

🗣️ What to tell mentor (perfect line)

“Milestone 2 focuses on floor plan uploads, bulk space import, and basic hierarchy APIs as per the project document.”

✍️ English improvement (your message)

You wrote:

“bro, this is my milestone 2 have you seen”

Better:
👉 “Bro, this is my Milestone 2. Have you seen it?”

🚀 NEXT STEP (YOU CHOOSE)

Tell me what you want to start FIRST:

1️⃣ Design Milestone 2 backend architecture
2️⃣ Decide MinIO vs S3 (and why)
3️⃣ Plan APIs list for Milestone 2
4️⃣ Step-by-step execution plan (Weeks 3–4)

Just reply with the number bro 👊🔥



READY-MADE MENTOR EXPLANATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

If your mentor asks “What did you complete in Milestone 2?”, say this 👇

“In Milestone 2, I implemented hierarchical site management APIs for properties, buildings, floors, and spaces.
I added secure floor-plan uploads and bulk space import via CSV, protected with JWT authentication.
The data is validated, mapped to floors, and stored in MySQL.
All APIs were integration tested using Postman.”

Say it slowly and confidently — mentor will be satisfied.
